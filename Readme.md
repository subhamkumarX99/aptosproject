# TokenStaking Smart Contract

## Vision

The **TokenStaking** smart contract enables users to stake their tokens and earn rewards based on the amount staked and the duration of the stake. This decentralized system incentivizes users to lock their tokens for a specified period, helping maintain network stability while providing rewards to participants.

## Features

- **Stake Tokens**:
  - Users can stake their tokens for a specified duration, locking them in the contract to earn rewards.
- **Distribute Rewards**:
  - Rewards are calculated based on the staked amount and the staking duration, and are distributed to the staker.

## Future Scope

1. **Dynamic Reward Rates**:

   - Implement dynamic reward rates that adjust based on network conditions or staking pool size.

2. **Early Unstaking Penalties**:

   - Introduce penalties for users who withdraw their tokens before the staking period ends.

3. **Multi-Token Support**:
   - Expand support to allow staking of various types of tokens, offering more flexibility to users.

The **TokenStaking** contract provides an efficient way for users to earn rewards by staking their tokens, fostering long-term engagement and contributing to network stability.
